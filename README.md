# Memory Game Project

## About the project
* This is my initial submission for Project 2 for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 
* Starter code was provided by Udacity, you can see it [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).
* It included some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project and only one JS shuffle function for us to adapt to our purposes. 
* The objective was to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file to build out the app's functionality.

## Development

I followed the requirements as provided by the project specification [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view) as follows:
  - I build a the functionality of the cards grid, where cards are shuffled at every replay or restart.
  -  Added functionality to handle the clicks on the cards.
  -  Created the matching logic and the winning condition.
  -  Implemented additional functionality: moves count, star rating, timer, reset button.
  -  Created a modal popup: to congratulate at end of game, to display the player's stats, and provide buttons to close or play again.
  -  Due to time restrictions, I did very minimal css styling. I would like to improve it later.
